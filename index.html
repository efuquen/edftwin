                    Lead a team of engineers to develop and maintain web based services to financial data from Terminal backed services for both internal (Bloomberg.com, Bloomberg Mobile, BLAW, BGOV, etc.) and external clients. These services managed tens of millions of requests a day and delivered consistent response times in the 10's of ms. Technologies developed in Scala, Java, NodeJS, and Python while integrating with multiple data stores (MySQL, memcached, elasticsearch).

                    Worked with a team of a dozen or so software engineers to kickstart a new project in Scala. This project's goal was to become the new backbone for Getty Image asset ingestion (images, video, and audio) and provide a modern and consistent api and pipeline of those ingested images throughout the business. I provided guidance on good software development and design, particularly on the Scala programming language and tooling. I leveraged my previous work in scalable high performance systems to lead the development of the REST based API's to this new system, using Akka and Spray. I also worked heavily in developing the video transcoding piece using Rhozet, but exploring FFmpeg as a possible alternative. I designed the system with future requirements and growth in mind to lay the foundation for further work in this area.

                      ScriptEd is an non-profit organization that provides students at under-resourced schools with access to fundamental coding skills.

                      Along with three other volunteers, I teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery at a local high school. Twice a year we hold hackathons as mid-terms and finals to help cement the materials they have learned for the semester, during this time I help mentor students as they work.
